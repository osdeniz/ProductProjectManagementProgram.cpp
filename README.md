Nowadays, saving time is very important for companies. When companies cannot store and list their data properly, they face a serious waste of time. This problem can cause serious money loss to companies. To avoid this problem, we did make an application where companies with multiple product ranges and project management companies can follow their operational works (product and project management).

For small and large enterprises with multiple product ranges and especially for project management companies (eg construction companies); a program that adds, deletes, searches, lists, and reports products and projects, and also calculates and lists the total profit sharing.

4-Product Reporting Procedures:
All products entered into the system can be reported if you wish. Select Report All Products so that you can report. After choosing to report all products, all products registered in the system are reported with their details.
We have come to the end of the product process. Project transactions will be shown from the next page.
